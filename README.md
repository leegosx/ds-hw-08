# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Networks

## Owerview
This project focuses on analyzing and identifying errors in a statistical model. The objective is to detect and address potential inaccuracies and shortcomings that affect the model's accuracy and reliability. Additionally, this project demonstrates the creation, training, and testing of a fully connected neural network for recognizing handwritten digits. The neural network is built and trained using low-level TensorFlow operations on the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits.

### Key Results:
- Training accuracy: 92.3%
- Test accuracy: 90.32%
